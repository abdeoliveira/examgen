# Exam Generator 

Professors with focus on (but not restricted to) math sciences can generate individualised exams for each student.
Despite the questions are the same, variables and consequently the answers are different. Latex is in charge to beautifully build the PDFs.

Last but not least, an application for correction is included. All you have to do is to scan exams and provide the images to the Correction application.
It will read the images and extract students answers.Then, it will compare them to the right keys. A .csv file report is generated with students scores in the end. 

# Dependencies

1. ruby
2. tex-live
3. Also dependends on ruby gems: mini_magick, date, csv and... can't recall. Ruby will complain any missing ones :-)

# Usage

I have to write it as well...
