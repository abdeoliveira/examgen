# Exam Generator 

Professors with focus on (but not restricted to) math sciences can generate individualised exams for each student.
Despite the questions are the same, variables and consequently the answers are different. Latex is in charge to beautifully build the PDFs.

Last but not least, and application for correction from scanned exam images is included. 

# Dependencies

1. ruby
2. tex-live
3. Also dependends on ruby gems: mini_magick, date, csv and... can't recall. Ruby will complain any missing ones :-)

# Usage

I have to write it as well...
